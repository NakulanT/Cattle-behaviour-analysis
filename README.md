# Cattle Behavior Analysis 

## üìå Project Overview
This project presents an advanced cattle behavior monitoring system leveraging deep learning techniques for real-time analysis. By using YOLOv8 models, the system detects cattle behaviors such as standing, lying down, and eating. Additionally, cattle are identified using uniquely shaped and colored stickers, enabling precise individual tracking.

## üîç Problem Statement
Traditional cattle monitoring methods such as manual observation and electronic tags (e-tags) are inefficient, costly, and prone to errors. To overcome these limitations, our system utilizes computer vision to automate cattle behavior recognition and tracking.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Automated Cattle Behavior Detection:** Using YOLOv8 to classify behaviors (standing, lying, eating) in real-time.
- **Individual Cattle Identification:** Assigning unique stickers to track each cow over time.
- **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:** Providing farmers with detailed insights through an interactive dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
### **Frontend:**
- React.js (v18.2.0)
- Recharts for visualization
- Material-UI for UI components

### **Backend:**
- FLASK 
- YOLOv8 for object detection
- Pandas for data processing

### **Database & Storage:**
- CSV format for structured data storage
- JSON for API data exchange

## üîÑ System Workflow
The system operates using a dual-model architecture:
1. **Behavior Detection Model:** Detects standing, lying, and eating behaviors from video frames.
2. **Cattle Identification Model:** Recognizes individual cattle using uniquely shaped and colored stickers.
3. **Data Processing Pipeline:** Stores and analyzes behavior trends for monitoring cattle health.
4. **Dashboard:** Displays real-time insights and generates alerts for abnormal behaviors.
